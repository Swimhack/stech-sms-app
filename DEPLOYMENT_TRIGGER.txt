FORCE NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT - 2025-08-30-16:02:30

This file exists solely to trigger a new Netlify deployment.
The current deployment is stuck and not picking up the configuration fixes.

Changes that should be deployed:
- Fixed lib/config.js with fallback Twilio credentials  
- Added getTwilioDefault() method
- Updated validate() to use get() method with defaults
- Added environment variable debugging to health endpoint

Expected result after deployment:
- Health endpoint should show "twilioConfigured": true
- SMS functionality should work without environment variables
- deployTimestamp field should appear in health response
